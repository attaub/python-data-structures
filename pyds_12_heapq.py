A tree-based data structure with the heap property

Min-Heap: parent_val <= children_val.
Max-Heap: parent_val >= children_val.
Commonly used to implement priority queues.

A priority queue supports retrieving elements in order of their priority (lowest or highest).

Efficient Insertions, Deletions: O(log n) time

Use Cases:
Job Scheduling, Pathfinding Dynamic median finding

Python has a built-in library, heapq, supports min-heaps.
Implement a max-heap, by inverting values ( multiplying them by -1)
